# Temperature_prediction
Prediction of monthly average temperatures of the 5 most populous cities of India for the next 10 years.

The primary objective of time series forecasting is the prediction of future temperature values. The model has been evaluated over 60 years to predict maximum and minimum temperature using the last 33 years of data (1980â€“2013).
Temperature forecasting on a monthly and seasonal time scale has been extremely difficult for more than 20 years. A collection of statistical models for analyzing and predicting time series data is called the ARIMA model (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average). We create the best ARIMA model.The most relevant orders of the ARIMA models are chosen and assessed using the AIC-criterion after examination of the ACF and PACF autocorrelation plots. Using the available data, we want to demonstrate whether or not the earth's temperature is rising over time. In other words, our aim is to demonstrate the validity of so-called global warming. A Time series analysis can assist us in comprehending the underlying causes of the course of naturalistic change over time, or the impact of a planned or unanticipated event should be assessed intervention It was shown that the models that were obtained are being capable of capturing the dynamics of the time series data and projections should be reasonable.
